### Project Setup and Configuration System Implementation

Today I implemented the core configuration system for aidoctool, following SOLID design principles and patterns from my experience with pywikicli:

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Created a modular project structure with separate directories for commands and tests
   - Added a proper .gitignore for Python projects
   - Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies (PyYAML, python-dotenv, click)

2. **Configuration Architecture**:
   - Designed a flexible configuration system that supports multiple config sources (YAML, environment variables)
   - Implemented Factory + Strategy pattern with ConfigLoader interface and concrete implementations (YamlConfigLoader, EnvConfigLoader)
   - Added ConfigManager abstraction for both CLI and library use cases, supporting read-write or read-only operations
   - Structured configuration to support multiple named profiles with providers, models, API keys, and parameters

3. **CLI Implementation**:
   - Set up a modular CLI framework with Click, following the command pattern
   - Implemented configuration commands (add, edit, delete, default)
   - Added debug commands for troubleshooting (config, info)
   - Used dependency injection to provide config management capabilities to commands

4. **Testing**:
   - Wrote comprehensive tests for configuration and debug commands using pytest and Click's CliRunner
   - Used test fixtures and monkeypatching to isolate tests from the real filesystem
   - Fixed PYTHONPATH issues for proper test discovery

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created Plan.md to document the configuration system design and next steps
   - Created DeveloperGuide_CLI.md with detailed explanation of the modular CLI architecture pattern
   - Ensured code has proper docstrings and comments

### Lessons Learned & Best Practices Applied

- **SOLID Principles**: Each class/module has a single responsibility, and the code is open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for instantiating the appropriate configuration loader based on source.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for different configuration loading strategies.
- **Dependency Injection**: CLI commands depend on abstractions (ConfigManager), not concrete implementations.
- **Testability**: All components are designed to be easily testable in isolation.
- **Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for missing files, invalid formats, etc.

### Next Steps

1. Implement LLM client adapters for different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter).
2. Add core functionality commands (summarize, convert, etc.) using the configured LLM clients.
3. Enhance documentation with examples and usage patterns.
4. Implement additional configuration sources (Redis, API, etc.) as needed.
